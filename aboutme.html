						<h3>About Me:</h3>
						<h4 class="lead">Over the past several years I've been very passionate about interaction, UX/UI, and web design. I also

						have extensive experience in leadership through my time in theatre, my position as a Resident Advisor, 

						and my new role as the CTO for my mobile app, CardSwapr. As I pursue my BS in Informatics (with 

						a focus on Human-Computer Interaction) at the University of Washington, my growing portfolio of 

						projects and unmatched work ethic will lead to an exciting and eventful career in these fields.</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h3>Background:</h3>
						<h4 class="lead">
						Originally from Bellevue, WA, I have lived throughout Western Washington, from Seattle to where I 

						currently reside; Gig Harbor, WA. I went to Charles Wright Academy for high school, where I was given

						the opportunity to receive an excellent education. I now attend the University of Washington in Seattle

						and have achieved admission into the competitive Informatics program as a sophomore, where I am 

						taking upper division courses in subjects such as web development, information management, and 

						design.</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h3>Interests:</h3>
						<h4 class="lead">
						I am an active professional actor all around Seattle. Iâ€™ve been in leading roles at the 5th Avenue Theatre, 

						Balagan Theatre, and Seattle Children's Theatre. Additionally, I am an avid composer. My 

						musical "The Roaring 21st" has been undergoing multiple workshops at the Balagan Theatre for the past 
						two years. Finally, I have a huge interest in photography! Every photo on this site (except for the one's of me, of course) were taken by me!</h4>
